# Language Translator

## What is Language Translator?

Language Translator is a python script made for the use of translating from one language to another. It has a not-pretty-but-smooth GUI - *we don't like terminal-based apps right?* 

As of now, only four languages are supported since it's just a progressions project. Even though it's not the most well-optimized code, it still runs with pretty much no errors besides the limitation of the libraries that are used.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10.4 (Version this script was origanally written in)
- translate 3.6.1 

## Installation

- Download the **main.py** file.
- Start up your command prompt and change directory to the file's location.
- Type `python main.py` in the command prompt and press Enter.

## Troubleshooting

Currently there is no way for users to troubleshoot. Best thing you can do is open an issue and describe how I can re-create the bug!
