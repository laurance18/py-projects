# Countdown Timer

## What is Countdown Timer?

Countdown Timer is a python-based desktop application which acts as a countdown timer. Again, it has the same GUI the previous projects had with some little tweaks to it. The code may be a little un-optimized but I believe it is well-commented and everything should become very clear after some inspection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10.4

## Installation

- Download the **main.py** file.
- Start up your command prompt and change directory to the file's location.
- Type `python main.py` in the command prompt and press Enter.

## Troubleshooting

Currently there is no way for users to troubleshoot. Best thing you can do is open an issue and describe how I can re-create the bug!
