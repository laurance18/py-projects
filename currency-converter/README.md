# Currency Converter

## What is Currency Converter?

Currency Converter is a python script made for the use of converting currencies according to forex exchange rates. It has the same simple-design GUI as the Language Translator project I made.

~~Only a handful of choices available as currencies since I used a dropdown menu, but I will implement a feature where user can type in the ISO code of the desired currencies themselves.~~ 
Manual ISO Code input system has been implemented. Error handling and message boxes unique to the error has been added.

## Requirements
